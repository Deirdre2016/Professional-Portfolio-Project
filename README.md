# Professional-Portfolio-Project

This was a Final Semester college project to demonstrate skills learnt on a 1 year BSc Web Technologies & Programming course at GMIT, Galway.  I've included course material (labs, lectures, assignments) for the entire course selectively, sometimes including entire modules and other times selected specific material.  The Report which is included in this project is self explanatory and this project can be easily deployed on WAMP web server. Just create 2 files (1) 'Professional Portfolio Project', and a 
sub-directory (2) 'Portfolio Website'. Then in 'Portfolio Website' include all the folders listed on here, and when it's finished, put the created folder 'Professional Portfolio Project' into www folder in WAMP directory on your computer. I've made all the hyperlink references so that this website should run smoothly, and those labs that require a server (AJA, PHP, etc), have hyperlinks containing 'http://localhost/....etc, etc'. 

The path which contains the project should look like this:-

c:/wamp64/www/Professional Portfolio Project/Portfolio Website 
(or)
http:/localhost/ Professional Portfolio Project/Portfolio Website

I’ve used localhost/...in hyperlinks throughout the project for those pages which require WAMP web server to load. WAMP server is essential to be able to view this project and I hope the instructions above on how to set it up are helpful.


**Please note: I’ve uploaded my project in zip file format.  Initially due to difficulties adding the complete project zip file, I had to split my project into two parts (Portfolio Website1 and Portfolio Website2) - the idea being to integrate these two folders into one (Portfolio Website).  HOWEVER, I eventually RESOLVED this problem by cloning this repository to a local directory on my computer and being able to add the COMPLETE Portfolio Website (zipped). 
After cloning repository I simply used $ git add . and $ git commit - "Add existing file" and $ git push origin master to upload the COMPLETE portfolio website
