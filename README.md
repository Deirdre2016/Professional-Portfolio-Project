# Professional-Portfolio-Project

This was a Final Semester college project to demonstrate skills learnt on a 1 year BSc Web Technologies & Programming course at GMIT, Galway.  I've included course material (labs, lectures, assignments) for the entire course selectively, sometimes including entire modules and other times selected specific material.  The Report which is included in this project is self explanatory and this project can be easily deployed on WAMP web server. Just create 2 files (1) 'Professional Portfolio Project', and a 
sub-directory (2) 'Portfolio Website'. Then in 'Portfolio Website' include all the folders listed on here, and when it's finished, put the created folder 'Professional Portfolio Project' into www folder in WAMP directory on your computer. I've made all the hyperlink references so that this website should run smoothly, and those labs that require a server (AJA, PHP, etc), have hyperlinks containing 'http://localhost/....etc, etc'. 

**Please note: I’ve uploaded my project in zip file format, due to time restraints and not having enough time to commit the project via git bash command line, as this is throwing errors and having tried it, there are problems with ‘pushing’ my repository, and even if I ‘pulled’ first, it makes no difference. So it is easier to just upload a zip file. Please also note that due to the size of the file (over 25 MB), I’ve had to split my project into two parts (Portfolio Website1 and Portfolio Website2).  Portfolio Website1 contains the following files (below), and remaining files are in Portfolio Website2.  The idea is to integrate both files into one, see snapshot picture of all fines in Report in this repository.  This is how the files should be stored, first in a folder called “Professional Portfolio Project” and sub-folder ‘Portfolio Website’. The path which contains the project should look like this.  I’ve used localhost/...in hyperlinks throughout the project for those pages which require WAMP web server to load. 

Website1 contains following files:-          Website2 contains all remaining files (BOTH files should be integrated into ONE).
